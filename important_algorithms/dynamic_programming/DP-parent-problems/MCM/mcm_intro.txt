Problems in MCM

1) MCM => Recursive, Memoized (iterative makes confusion here)
2) Printing MCM
3) Evaluate expression to true or boolean parenthesis
4) min/max of expression
5) palindrome partitioning
6) Scramble string 
7) Egg droping problem

more info: 

- in general, use Recursive and memoization method to solve MCM problems, iterative methods and solution are complex and hard to understand and decode. Go with Memoization. 
- To understand MCM format and question pattern, focus on understanding MCM (1) and Evaluate expression problem.
